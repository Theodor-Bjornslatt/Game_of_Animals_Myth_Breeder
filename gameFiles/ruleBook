RULEBOOK
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SINGLEPLAYER
The player must make it through their chosen number of rounds.

The player chooses how many rounds to play and must make it through
to the last round owning something of value - be it animals or gold.
If the player does not have enough gold left to buy a new animal and
does not own any animals, the game ends and the player loses.
At the end of the game, the player's animals are sold and their gold
is counted.


MULTIPLAYER
2-4 players.

If a player does not own any animals and does not have enough gold
left to buy a new animal, they're out of the game. The last player
left, wins. If more than one player make it to the end of the chosen
number of rounds, their animals are sold and the player with the most
gold wins.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROGRESSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the end of a turn, each of a player's animals loses 10-30
health points and have a 20% chance of becoming sick. A diseased
animal will lose it's remaining health if it does not receive
treatment. If an animal reaches 0 health, it dies at the start
of the next round.

Animals can regain health by being fed and can only be cured of
disease by going to the hospital.

Each player must choose to perform ONE of the following moves per turn:


BUYING ANIMALS OR FOOD

These are the only moves a player can choose between when they own no
animals. When shopping, a player may buy as many animals or types of
food as they please. Their turn ends when a transaction has been made
and the player leaves the store.


FEEDING ANIMALS

If a player owns food and animals, they may feed their animals to
restore their health. Some animals eat more than one type of food and
each food is differently beneficial (see "Animals and Food").
When the player has fed as many animals as they want, their turn ends.


BREEDING ANIMALS

When a player owns two animals of the same species, but of opposite
genders, they may try to breed them for a 50% chance at offspring.
Different species have a maximum amount of offspring, and how many
babies they have at a given time is randomized. A player may only
try to mate one pair of animals during their turn, when they choose
this action.


SELLING ANIMALS

A player may sell as many of their animals as they please. When sold,
the gold the player gains is dependent on the animal's health.


HOSPITALIZE

The only way to save a diseased animal is by sending it to the
hospital. If an animal does not receive treatment, it will die at the
beginning of the player's next round.
To try curing an animal of its disease, a player must pay an amount of
gold dependent on the animal species and health of their animal.

There is a 50% chance that the animal will be cured. If treatment is
not successful, the animal dies.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANIMALS AND FOOD
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are five different species of animals and three types
of food.

Each animal only eats certain food types, and each
food type has its own "foodvalue" - a basic amount by which
it restores hunger. Each animal species also has a basic hunger
satisfaction, which determines how much that species benefits
from eating.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOODVALUES

Helpless human: 3
Seaweed: 2
Milk: 1

------------------------------------------------------------------------

EATING RESTORES HEALTH

When an animal eats they gain a set amount of health per kilogram
of food which depends on the food type and the animal species.
It is calculated as follows:

Gained health per kg of food = foodvalue * hunger satisfaction

Example:
A Kraken fed with 1 kg of seaweed would regain
2 (foodvalue) * 4 (hunger satisfaction) = 8 health points.

Fed with 1kg of helpless human, the same kraken would regain
3 (foodvalue) * 4 (hunger satisfaction) = 12 health points.
